# SQL_and_T-SQL Project
# Project Title

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of two datasets: "Banking Transactions" and "Covid-19 Deaths and Vaccinations." The "Banking Transactions" dataset likely contains information on account transactions, including details such as account numbers, transaction amounts, types, and timestamps. The "Covid-19 Deaths and Vaccinations" dataset contains data on Covid-19-related information, focusing on deaths and vaccinations, with details such as dates, locations, and counts.

## Analysis

### Banking Transactions
Objective: The goal is likely to manage and analyze banking transactions using SQL (Structured Query Language) and T-SQL (Transact-SQL), which is Microsoft's extension of SQL.
- Analyzing transaction patterns over time.
- Identifying anomalies or irregularities in transactions.
- Calculating summary statistics such as total deposits, withdrawals, and account balances.
- Segmenting customers based on transaction behavior.

### Covid-19 Deaths and Vaccinations
Objective: This subproject to analyze and derive insights from data related to Covid-19, specifically focusing on deaths and vaccinations.
- Analyzing the trend of Covid-19 deaths over time.
- Examining the vaccination coverage and distribution.
- Correlating vaccination rates with the decline in deaths.
- Geographic analysis to identify hotspots or areas with higher mortality rates.



Feel free to explore the provided datasets and adapt the analysis workflow based on your specific project goals.
